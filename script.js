/*
PROJECT BRIEF:
- Write the necessary JavaScript for a working program that does the following:
1. Generates a silly story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed.
2. Replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed.
3. Converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story to UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed.
4. Generates a new random silly story every time the button is pressed.
